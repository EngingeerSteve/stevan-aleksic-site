        <h1>Building My Personal Website on a Raspberry Pi</h1>

        <p>
            I built this website as a personal space to document my work, share projects,
            and experiment with infrastructure decisions in a controlled environment.
            Instead of starting with frameworks or cloud services, I chose to begin
            with a simple, self-hosted setup.
        </p>

        <h2>Why a Raspberry Pi</h2>
        <p>
            Using a Raspberry Pi allowed me to work close to the system itself. I wanted
            full control over the operating system, networking, and services instead of
            abstracting everything away behind managed platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal was not performance or scale, but understanding and ownership.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Setup</h2>
        <p>
            The site runs as a static website served by Nginx on a Raspberry Pi connected
            to my local network. The content is written in plain HTML and CSS, which keeps
            the system simple, fast, and easy to reason about.
        </p>

        <p>
            Version control is handled through Git and GitHub, allowing changes to be
            tracked and deployed intentionally.
        </p>

        <h2>Deliberate Simplicity</h2>
        <p>
            I intentionally avoided adding a backend, JavaScript frameworks, or container
            orchestration at this stage. The site does not require dynamic content yet,
            and introducing additional layers would add complexity without real benefit.
        </p>

        <p>
            This approach makes the system easier to maintain and easier to evolve when
            actual requirements emerge.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple systems are easier to reason about and debug</li>
            <li>Static sites can still demonstrate strong engineering fundamentals</li>
            <li>Infrastructure decisions should follow requirements, not trends</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What’s Next</h2>
        <p>
            The next steps for this site include expanding the project section, adding
            more written content, and potentially introducing backend services only when
            they are justified by real use cases.
